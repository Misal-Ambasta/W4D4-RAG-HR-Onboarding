# HR Onboarding Knowledge Assistant (RAG)

A modern AI-powered assistant to automate HR onboarding Q&A using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project replaces manual HR induction calls with an interactive AI assistant. Employees can instantly query company policies, benefits, leave policies, and employment terms from uploaded HR documents. Admins can manage documents, monitor usage, and keep the knowledge base up to date.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Document Upload:** Upload PDF, DOCX, and TXT HR documents via a beautiful admin dashboard.
- **Automated Processing:** Extracts, chunks, and embeds HR content using OpenAI and LangChain, storing vectors in ChromaDB.
- **Conversational AI:** Employees chat with the assistant to get instant answers, with policy citations and source snippets.
- **Query Categorization:** All queries are auto-tagged (Benefits, Leave, Conduct, General) and usage stats are tracked persistently.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage documents, view status, delete files, update categories, and see real usage stats.
- **Document Category Persistence:** Categories are stored and updated in the backend, not just client-side.
- **Rich Metadata:** All vectors are stored with document metadata for precise retrieval.
- **Modern UI:** Built with React and TailwindCSS for a polished, responsive experience.
